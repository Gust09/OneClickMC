OneClickMC
===========

A minecraft launcher that gets you in-game with just one click!
It uses your existing authentication settings, it's ideal if you play very often, so you don't need to wait for the official complex launcher to start for so long.
Uses MCLauncher-API - https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api
